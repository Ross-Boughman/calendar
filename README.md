This project uses dayjs and Jquery to create a day planner. By comparing real time to the listed time on each time block, we are able to dynamically update the page to reflect which time slots are in the past, present, and future of the full 24 hour day. When the user enters data into the text boxes, that data is saved in local storage, to be pulled and displayed the next time the user opens the page.
